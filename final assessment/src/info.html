      <h2>History of the Game</h2>
      <p>
        Tic-Tac-Toe, also known as noughts and crosses or Xs and Os, is an ancient game with a long
        history. The exact origins of the game are unclear, but it is believed to have been played
        by the ancient Egyptians and Romans. It gained popularity in Europe during the 18th and 19th
        centuries, and its simple rules made it a favorite pastime for people of all ages. Today,

      <h2>Rules of Game Play and How to Play</h2>
      <p>
        Tic-Tac-Toe is played on a 3x3 grid, and two players take turns marking the spaces with X or
        O. The game starts with an empty grid, and the first player marks an X in any of the nine
        spaces. The second player then marks an O in any remaining space. The players continue
        taking turns until one of them gets three of their marks in a row, either horizontally,
        vertically, or diagonally. If the grid is full and no one has three in a row, the game is a
        tie. The rules are simple, but mastering the strategy to win can be challenging!

      <h2>Tips and Strategies for Winning</h2>
      <p>
        While Tic-Tac-Toe may seem like a simple game, there are strategies you can use to increase
        your chances of winning. One common strategy is to take the center space if it's available,
        as it gives you more opportunities to create winning combinations. Blocking your opponent's
        potential winning moves is another crucial tactic to employ. Additionally, try to create
        forks, where you have two potential winning moves on the same turn, forcing your opponent to
        block one, leaving the other open. Practice and observation of your opponent's moves are key
        to becoming a skilled Tic-Tac-Toe player.
