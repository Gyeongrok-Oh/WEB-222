    <p>
      Tic-Tac-Toe is a classic game that is easy to learn and fun to play.<br />
      It is also known as noughts and crosses or Xs and Os. <br />
      The game is played on a 3x3 grid, where two players take turns marking the spaces with X or O.
      <br />
      The goal is to make three of your marks in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or
      diagonally. <br />
      If the grid is full and no one has made three in a row, the game is a tie.
    </p>
    <h3>Here are the basic steps to play Tic-Tac-Toe:</h3>
    <p>1.Decide who will be X and who will be O. X always goes first.</p>
    <p>2.Draw a 3x3 grid on a piece of paper or use an online board.</p>
    <p>
      3.Take turns placing your mark on an empty space on the grid. You can only mark one space per
      turn.
    </p>
    <p>
      4.Check if you have made three of your marks in a row. If you have, you win the game and can
      celebrate. If not, continue to step 5.
    </p>
    <p>
      5.Check if the grid is full. If it is, the game is a tie and no one wins. If not, go back to
      step 3 and repeat until someone wins or the game is a tie.
