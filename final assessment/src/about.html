        <h2>Site and Creator</h2>
        <p>
          Hi, I'm Gyeongrok Oh, and seneca student from 19 years old, the creator of this
          Tic-Tac-Toe Game website! As an avid game enthusiast and web developer, I decided to
          create this website to showcase the classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe in a digital format.
          Tic-Tac-Toe holds a special place in my heart as it was one of the first games I learned
          to play during my childhood. Its simplicity and strategic elements have always fascinated
          me, and I wanted to share this nostalgic experience with others through this digital
          adaptation.

        <h2>Why Tic-Tac-Toe?</h2>
        <p>
          Tic-Tac-Toe, also known as noughts and crosses, is a timeless game that transcends
          generations. Its easy-to-learn rules make it accessible to players of all ages, while its
          strategic depth provides a challenge for those looking to sharpen their tactical skills.
          By creating this website, I aim to celebrate the game's rich history, engage players in a
          fun and interactive way, and promote the joy of playing Tic-Tac-Toe both as a casual
          pastime and a competitive activity.
